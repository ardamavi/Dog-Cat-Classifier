# Dog-Cat-Classifier-and-detector
Dog and cat image classification and detection using YOLO

->I used the YOLOv4 to detect the image and made a boundary box around the image using YOLOv4.
->I used the darknet open source neural network framework from the github because it can classify more then two classes ie. cat and dog
->I have not uploaded the darknet and weights because the size of those files are more than 25 MB that github doesnot allow.
